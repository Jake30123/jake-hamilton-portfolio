(*This is the essay that got me into Olin with pictures added.*)<br>
Instead of coffee to start that February day, I had fire to wake me up. It started at 4am with my mom banging on my basement bedroom door yelling that the garage was on fire. I ran out of bed, up the stairs, and out to the driveway where black smoke was billowing out of the garage. For a minute I did not process what was happening, but then, through the clouds, I saw orange flames in the shape of a bike. This e-bike was mine and its name was Blueberry. For more than two years, I’d been saving, building, and re-building my precious e-bike, which in the matter of an hour was gone. (The fire was in the concrete garage, the rest of the house was undamaged.)

Blueberry started life as a normal e-bike doing normal e-bike things. During the pandemic, we relocated to rural Virginia, and I worked around our family’s farm and saved money to buy this bike-- the shimmering blue paint and motorcycle styling had me hooked.

Blueberry and I had a good six months together. Blueberry happily chugged along as my daily commuter bike. I went to school, took every opportunity to explore DC alone, and went on long rides around DC, Maryland, and Virginia with the e-bike community I found.

Then I got the upgrade bug. It started when a key component in the battery failed and I had to fully tear down the bike to fix it. Looking at all the parts made me realize I could make this one bigger, make that just a bit better. And so, I did.

I went into the land of high voltage batteries and powerful motors supremely excited but with a lack of caution. This manifested when I blew up my first motor controller (the brain that tells the motor how fast to go), and the next, and then the next ones were poor quality since I did not know what to look for, and lo and behold they sparked and died too. Finally, on try number five, I was successful. I had re-wired the bike two, if not three, times and had upgraded a plethora of other components, so Frankenblueberry was doing quite well—except for not having a brain. But controller/brain number five got me up and running and I was overjoyed. My ideal vision for Blueberry was getting closer, and for another 9 months, I rode and modified. I also started a business repairing e-bikes with Blueberry as my company logo. Jake’s E-Bike Repair and my love for fixing bikes and building them stemmed from my failures and successes with Blueberry. I’d learned how to build batteries, wire controllers, and program an e-bike, as well as work on tires, brakes, and derailleurs, and I continued to tweak Blueberry to be closer and closer to my vision until I was mostly satisfied.

Then came that fateful morning when I watched as my pride and joy burned to the ground. I’d upgraded the battery with poorly-made cells and they gave out while charging that early morning.

The charred frame of Blueberry still sits in the corner of the garage. I’ve built myself a new bike from scratch, and it’s the perfection I had envisioned (with high quality battery cells!). I paid for it all with my repair business earnings, and I built it with my knowledge, both of which started with Blueberry. This is not the end of the road, however. Blueberry was severely damaged, but not completely broken. I am rebuilding it for my dad. The only parts of old Blueberry that will physically remain are the frame and the front wheel. But the bike will still be Blueberry. It is still built on the spirit of perseverance, it is still teaching me new things, and it is still that little bike that got me started two years ago and changed my life.
