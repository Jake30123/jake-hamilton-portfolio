### Overview
An ATV is a fun, easy to ride farm vehicle that even the tamest of riders can feel comfortable on. But what if you want more...

My mother was not satisfied with a pokey gas ATV and wanted an upgrade for touring her property. She challenged me to build a dead quiet, long range, and fast ATV that could tackle any terrain, and so I built one!

Frame: Kawasaki Bayou 220 <br>
Motor: QS138 V3 <br>
Battery: 60v 67AH Custom <br>
Suspension: Kawasaki Stock <br>
Controller: Fardriver ND72450 (200 bus amps, 450 phase)<br>
Top speed: 45 mph<br>
**Total Power: 12,000W**<br>

### Build Process
The ATV had humble begginings as a 1997 Kawasaki Bayou 220 that had seen many bettery days. <br>

*The facebook marketplace listing photo for the ATV.* <br>
I purchased the ATV, in a non-running condition, from facebook marketplace for $500. It was rusty, spray painted an atrocious gold, and was overall a bit sad. Before I could do anything else, I needed to clean it up.
