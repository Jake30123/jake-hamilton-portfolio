### Overview
An ATV is a fun, easy to ride farm vehicle that even the tamest of riders can feel comfortable on. But what if you want more...

My mother was not satisfied with a pokey gas ATV and wanted an upgrade for touring her property. She challenged me to build a dead quiet, long range, and fast ATV that could tackle any terrain, and so I built one!

Frame: Kawasaki Bayou 220 <br>
Motor: QS138 V3 <br>
Battery: 60v 67AH Custom <br>
Suspension: Kawasaki Stock <br>
Controller: Fardriver ND72450 (200 bus amps, 450 phase)<br>
Top speed: 45 mph<br>
**Total Power: 12,000W**<br>

### Build Process
The ATV had humble begginings as a 1997 Kawasaki Bayou 220 that had seen many bettery days. <br>

I purchased the ATV, in a non-running condition, from facebook marketplace for $500. It was rusty, spray painted an atrocious gold, and was overall a bit sad. Before I could do anything else, I needed to clean it up. 

##### Cleaning and Painting
I ripped absolutely everything off of the ATV. The only thing left at the end was the bare frame. I took a wire brush, detergent, and a garden hose and spent a whole day cleaning all of the parts I wanted to re-use. <br>

I really wanted to re-paint the entire frame but I did not have the resources to strip all of the paint off, wire brush everything, and then re-paint it in a clean way. The frame was also in fine condition so I left that. Seeing as my mothers favorite color is pink I had to re-paint some parts of it pink to fit her aesthetic. <br>

I also planned to paint all of the body panels in camo-pink but I needed to learn more about painting before diving into that project. 

##### Battery and Electronics
Range anxiety really takes the fun out of riding so I wanted this ATV to have way more range than necessary. To accomplish this I purchased two Samsung 8s 67AH prismatic cell modules and wired them in series. This provided a total energy capacity of 3,966 Wh. <br>

To control this battery I used a JK 200A continous BMS since it perfectly alligned with the 200A controller and JK is well regarded in the battery building world. And while I do prefer ANT BMS', I opted for the JK since it had 1A balancing instead of the 180ma found on the ANT because the cell capacity was so large and needed higher balancing. 

Originally, for the controller I went for a Sabvoton SVMC 72200, like on the city ripper. But as with that controller, I had a MOSFET short to the cooling plate underneat and the controller went up in flames. So, I purchased a newer Fardriver 72450 that had the same power specs, a better interface and features, and it was less than half the price. <br>

##### Motor Integration
Integrating an aftermarket motor made with Chinese manufacturing standards into 28 year old Japanese ATV was really hard. The biggest challange I faced was making a spline adapter that went between the motors output shaft to the rear diffirentials input shaft. 

I made 4 different adapter designs before I found the perfect fit for the splines.
