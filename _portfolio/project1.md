### Overview
The City Ripper was designed to provide the most fun experience possible in a small, lightweight platform that is perfect for all city conditions. This bike integrated long travel suspension with sticky street tires that allow the rider to hop curbs, cut across grass, and hit pot holes without a care in the world. 

It has enough power to keep up with highway traffic for short sprints and enough torque to beat any sports car at a stop light, all while weighing 130lbs. This bike is incredibly nimble and untutitive whether you're pulling a wheelie on a long straight or winding through stopped city traffic.

### Build Process
The bones of this bike come from a comany called EEB, a chinese factory that cells frames and components direct to consumer. This is their "Enduro" frame that is designed for long travel suspension, a large battery, and a hub motor. I selected this frame as it was lightweight at only 22lbs (8 lbs less than just the motor). EEB is also known for high quality welds on their frames, good customer support, and a wide range of accesories along with standardized components for easy off the shelf assembly. 

To start the build process I purchased the frame, plastic panels, suspension, wheels, and motor from a variety of suppliers on Alibaba.
