### Overview
The City Ripper was designed to provide the most fun experience possible in a small, lightweight platform that is perfect for all city conditions. This bike integrated long travel suspension with sticky street tires that allow the rider to hop curbs, cut across grass, and hit pot holes without a care in the world. 

It has enough power to keep up with highway traffic for short sprints and enough torque to beat any sports car at a stop light, all while weighing 130lbs. This bike is incredibly nimble and untutitive whether you're pulling a wheelie on a long straight or winding through stopped city traffic. 

Frame: EEB Enduro <br>
Motor: QS 205 + Ferrofluid <br>
Battery: 76v 48ah Custom <br>
Suspension: DNM USD-8 and DNM Shock<br>
Controller: Fardriver ND72530 (330 bus amps, 530 phase)<br>
Top speed: 70 mph<br>
**Total Power: 14,000W**<br>

### Build Process
The bones of this bike come from a comany called EEB, a chinese factory that cells frames and components direct to consumer. This is their "Enduro" frame that is designed for long travel suspension, a large battery, and a hub motor. I selected this frame as it was lightweight at only 22lbs (8 lbs less than just the motor). EEB is also known for high quality welds on their frames, good customer support, and a wide range of accesories along with standardized components for easy off the shelf assembly. 

To start the build process I purchased the frame, plastic panels, suspension, wheels, and motor from a variety of suppliers.

After about a 3-months of waiting for all of the parts to arrive, I started to assemble! This process proved tricky since I did not have professional bike shop tools and was forced to make some janky assembly set ups.<br>

The suspension and frame assembly went relatively smoothly as it was a process I had done a couple times before when replacing the suspension on my Sur-Ron motorcycle. <br>

*The bike mostly assembled without a wiring harness.*<br>
The two major assembly challenges I had with this bike were the battery and the controller. 

##### Battery Build
I built the battery for the bike in a flat configuration with the idea of folding it together to make my desired shape.

*The battery in its flat configuration, pre-folding.*<br>
While my concept was solid, I ended up placing the folds in the wrong places so the battery wanted to fold in on itself, not stack. This was incredibly dissapointing as I had to then cut the battery back into its individual segments and solder them together independently. <br>

*The segments of the battery seperately and then soldered together.*<br>

In the end the battery turned out perfectly and met my design requirements for weight, voltage, and capacity.

With the battery finished I was then able to assemble the rest of the bike and get to riding!<br>

##### Controller Troubles
The other big issue besides the battery that I had was my controller. The controller I initially used was a Sabvoton SVMC72200. While this controller used to be a go-to for high-powered bike builders, the company had recently come under new management and quality decreased. As of writing this, I have burned through 3 $450 Sabvoton controllers which has been quite infuriating. 

While riding to school one day, I was accelerating quickly from a stop light and all of a sudden my rear wheel locks up and the entire bike shuts down. There was also a good deal of magic smoke coming out of the controller (the grey box underneath the front part of the frame seen in the last picture). From a post-mortem analysis I concluded that one of the MOSFETs had welded itself to the cooling plate, I don't know how but it did. This caused the motor to start acting like a completely shorted generator thus locking up the rear wheel. The other two Sabvoton controllers failed in the same way about a year or two later. 

After this failure I switeched to Fardriver controllers due to their low cost, high power, FOC technology, and their bluetooth capabilities. I was absolutely blown away by the build quality and features for the price and they are now my go-to controller for any project. <br>
