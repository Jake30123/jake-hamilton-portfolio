### Overview
The City Ripper was designed to provide the most fun experience possible in a small, lightweight platform that is perfect for all city conditions. This bike integrated long travel suspension with sticky street tires that allow the rider to hop curbs, cut across grass, and hit pot holes without a care in the world. 

It has enough power to keep up with highway traffic for short sprints and enough torque to beat any sports car at a stop light, all while weighing 130lbs. This bike is incredibly nimble and untutitive weather you're pulling a wheelie on a long straight or winding through stopped city traffic.
