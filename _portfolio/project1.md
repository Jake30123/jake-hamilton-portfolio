### Overview
The City Ripper was designed to provide the most fun experience possible in a small, lightweight platform that is perfect for all city conditions. This bike integrates long-travel suspension with sticky street tires that allow the rider to hop curbs, cut across grass, and hit potholes without a care in the world.

It has enough power to keep up with highway traffic for short sprints and enough torque to beat any sports car at a stoplight, all while weighing only 130 lbs. This bike is incredibly nimble and intuitive, whether you're pulling a wheelie on a long straight or winding through stopped city traffic.

#### Build Process
The bones of this bike come from a company called EEB, a Chinese factory that sells frames and components directly to the consumer. This is their "Enduro" frame, which is designed for long-travel suspension, a large battery, and a hub motor. I selected this frame because it was lightweight at only 22 lbs (8 lbs less than the motor alone). EEB is also known for high-quality welds on its frames, good customer support, and a wide range of accessories, along with standardized components for easy off-the-shelf assembly.

To start the build process, I purchased the frame, plastic panels, suspension, wheels, and motor from a variety of suppliers.

After about three months of waiting for all the parts to arrive, I started to assemble! This process proved tricky since I did not have professional bike shop tools and was forced to create some janky assembly setups.

The suspension and frame assembly went relatively smoothly, as it was a process I had done a couple of times before when replacing the suspension on my Sur-Ron motorcycle.

The two major assembly challenges I had with this bike were the battery and the controller.

##### Battery Build
I built the battery for the bike in a flat configuration with the idea of folding it to create my desired shape.

While my concept was solid, I ended up placing the folds in the wrong places, so the battery wanted to fold in on itself, not stack. This was incredibly disappointing, as I had to then cut the battery back into its individual segments and solder them together independently.

In the end, the battery turned out perfectly and met my design requirements for weight, voltage, and capacity.

With the battery finished, I was then able to assemble the rest of the bike and get to riding!

##### Controller Troubles
The other big issue I had besides the battery was the controller. The controller I initially used was a Sabvoton SVMC72200. While this controller used to be a go-to for high-powered bike builders, the company had recently come under new management, and quality had decreased. As of this writing, I have burned through three $450 Sabvoton controllers, which has been quite infuriating.

While riding to school one day, I was accelerating quickly from a stoplight when all of a sudden my rear wheel locked up and the entire bike shut down. There was also a good deal of magic smoke coming out of the controller (the gray box underneath the front part of the frame, seen in the last picture). From a post-mortem analysis, I concluded that one of the MOSFETs had welded itself to the cooling plate. This caused the motor to act like a completely shorted generator, thus locking up the rear wheel. The other two Sabvoton controllers failed in the same way about a year or two later.

After this failure, I switched to Fardriver controllers due to their low cost, high power, FOC technology, and Bluetooth capabilities. I was absolutely blown away by the build quality and features for the price, and they are now my go-to controller for any project.
